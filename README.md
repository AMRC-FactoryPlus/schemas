# Original ACS schemas repository

**This repository is archived and read-only.**

When ACS was first published, this repo held the schemas. The Manager
pulled the schema definitions directly from here.

This repo has been replaced by `acs-schemas`, which has a different
layout and is not pulled from directly by ACS services. This repo has
been preserved for the sake of existing ACS installations which still
use it.
